#+TITLE: Redux
* Meta
- Node package that implements Flux
* Principles
1. Single source of truth
   - There is one single store (called the "state tree")
2. State is read-only
   - To change it, dispatch an action
   - Actions go one at a time, so this ensures single threading
3. Only pure functions (dispatch actions to) change state
   - Pure functions are known as "reducers".
     - They take
       - Previous state
       - Action
     - They return
       - New state
