#+TITLE: Code Smells
These are reasons to refactor code. They indicate not that there /is/ a
problem, but that there /may be/ a problem. They are also really good
fodder for git commit messages (since they explain reasoning behind
changes).
* Duplicated code
- DRY
* Long methods
* Many parameters
* Data clump
* Long method chains
Too many dots: ~bicycle.front_tire.rotate~ instead of the preferred ~bicycle.rotate_tires~.
* Indecent exposure
* Speculative generality
- YAGNI
* God object
* Dead code
